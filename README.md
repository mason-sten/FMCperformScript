# FMCperformScript

FMCperformScript or FileMaker Connect Perform Script, makes it easier to communicate with FileMaker from a webviewer. FMCperformScript relies on a few FileMaker scripts being present in your FileMaker solution. At the bare minimum you need the following:

```
fmc-connect
fmc-connect-send-error-and-halt
```

The library also includeds a few other helper scripts including

```
fmc-connect-query
fmc-connect-goto
fmc-connect-sync-state
```

The easiest way to get started is by using the FMConnect add-on here.
